This allows you to store your installer files in a seperate module or else where on the disk.\n\nAuthor\n-------\ndhogland\n\nModifieing Authors\n-------\nWill Ferrer, Ethan Brooks\n\nLicensees\n-------\n2012 developed under license for Switchsoft LLC http://www.switchsoft.com a \"Direct response telephony company\" as part of it's \"VOIP Call distribution, ROI analysis platform, call recording, and IVR for inbound and outbound sales\" and Run the Business Systems LLC a \"Technology development investment group\" as part of it's \"PHP, Javascript rapid application development framework and MySQL analysis tools\"\n\nLicense\n-------\nLicensed under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0\n\n\nContact\n-------\nwill.ferrer@runthebusiness.net\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nPlease send tickets and issues to our contact email address or at: https://github.com/runthebusiness/puppet-splunk/issues\n\nProject Url\n-------\nhttps://github.com/runthebusiness/puppet-splunk\n\n",
